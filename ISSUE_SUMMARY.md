# Critical Issues Summary

## Issue 1: JavaScript Not Being Executed ❌

### Problem:
- Code is being TESTED but not APPLIED to the page
- The service worker has `applyVariationCode()` method that uses `chrome.scripting.executeScript()`
- But this method is NEVER called during generation or testing

### Evidence:
- Service worker logs show: "Testing complete | status=fail"
- No logs from `applyVariationCode()` or `chrome.scripting.executeScript()`
- Content script correctly says "JS will be executed by service worker" but service worker never does it

### Root Cause:
Testing (`testGeneratedCode`) sends `TEST_CODE` message to content script for validation, but doesn't actually APPLY the code using `applyVariationCode()`.

### Solution Needed:
After code generation, need to call `applyVariationCode()` to actually execute the JavaScript on the page.

## Issue 2: Element Database Context May Not Be Sent ⚠️

### Problem:
Generated code has wrong selector: `button.btn.btn--primary` (generic)
Should have specific selector from element database

### Need to Verify:
1. Is `pageData.elementDatabase` being passed to AI?
2. Is the prompt instructing AI to use selectors from database?
3. Are we sending screenshot for visual context?

## Issue 3: Visual QA Not Running ⚠️

### Problem:
No Visual QA logs visible
Need to check if Visual QA is integrated into the testing pipeline

---

## Issue 4: No Status Updates in UI ❌

### Problem:
User can't see what's happening during generation/testing
Need consistent status panel across all workflow states

### Solution Needed:
Add live status updates showing:
- "Generating code with Claude Sonnet 4..."
- "Testing variation 1..."
- "Applying changes to page..."
- "Running Visual QA..."
