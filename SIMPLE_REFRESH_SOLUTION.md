# Simple Page Refresh Fix

The most reliable solution is to refresh the page before each iteration to guarantee a clean DOM state. This eliminates all the complexity of trying to track and undo DOM modifications.

## Implementation

1. **Always refresh page before iterations** (iterations > 0)
2. **Preserve base page data** across refreshes
3. **Re-inject content scripts** after refresh
4. **Add proper error handling** to adjustCode method

This ensures that:
- Each iteration starts with the exact same clean page state
- No DOM modifications carry over between iterations  
- Visual QA gets accurate before/after comparisons
- The system is simple and reliable

The trade-off is a slight delay from page refresh, but this guarantees correctness.
