- Final performance validation
- Code cleanup

## RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES

### Technical Risks
1. **Feature Regression**: Comprehensive test suite + parallel running
2. **Performance Degradation**: Continuous monitoring + rollback ready  
3. **User Confusion**: Gradual rollout + extensive documentation
4. **API Breaking**: Maintain existing APIs + versioning

### Execution Risks
1. **Scope Creep**: Strict phase boundaries + regular reviews
2. **Timeline Slippage**: Buffer time built in + MVP approach
3. **Quality Issues**: Automated testing + manual QA gates
4. **User Resistance**: Change management + feedback integration

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Performance Targets
- Load time: <2 seconds (current baseline)
- Memory usage: No increase >10%
- API response: <500ms for common operations
- User task completion: 70% reduction in steps

### Feature Completeness
- 100% existing feature parity
- Zero regression in core workflows
- Improved discoverability metrics
- Higher user satisfaction scores

## ROLLBACK PLAN
- Feature flags allow instant revert
- Database migrations are reversible
- UI components are independently deployable
- User preferences preserved during rollback
