# User Experience Fixes - COMPLETE âœ…

## ðŸŽ¯ Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. **White Screen Issue** âœ… FIXED
**Problem**: Interface was hidden by CSS rule
**Solution**: Added `data-active="true"` attribute activation in JavaScript
```javascript
mainApp.setAttribute('data-active', 'true');
```

### 2. **Screenshot Not Showing** âœ… FIXED  
**Problem**: Screenshot element wasn't being properly updated
**Solution**: Enhanced `updatePageInfo()` method with proper debugging and styling
```javascript
screenshot.src = pageData.screenshot;
screenshot.style.display = 'block';
```

### 3. **Buttons Not Visible on Building Screen** âœ… FIXED
**Problem**: Missing CSS for builder tools  
**Solution**: Added comprehensive CSS for `.tool-btn` elements
```css
.tool-btn {
  background: var(--bg-tertiary, #f3f4f6);

  padding: 8px 12px;
  /* ... responsive styling */
}
