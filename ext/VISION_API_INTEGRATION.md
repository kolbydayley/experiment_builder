# Vision API Integration - Full Context for AI

## What Was Changed

### ‚úÖ Now Sending Screenshot to AI
The extension now sends the **full-page screenshot** to OpenAI's vision models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini) so the AI can:
- **See** the exact visual elements to modify
- **Identify** colors, sizes, layouts visually
- **Generate accurate selectors** based on what it sees
- **Understand context** better than text alone

### ‚úÖ Increased HTML & CSS Limits
**Before:**
- HTML: 2,000 chars (~2KB) 
- CSS: 1,000 chars (~1KB)

**After:**
- HTML: 50,000 chars (~50KB) - **25x more!**
- CSS: 20,000 chars (~20KB) - **20x more!**

This gives the AI much more context about the page structure.

### ‚úÖ Updated Prompts
Added instructions telling the AI to:
- **USE THE SCREENSHOT** to identify elements
- **VERIFY SELECTORS** match visible elements
- **GENERATE ACCURATE CODE** based on visual inspection

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Screenshot Transmission
```javascript
// In generateCode() and adjustCode()
if (pageData.screenshot) {
  messages.push({
    role: 'user',
    content: [
      {
        type: 'image_url',
        image_url: {
          url: pageData.screenshot, // base64 data URL
          detail: 'high'             // High resolution
        }
      },
      {
        type: 'text',
        text: prompt
      }
    ]
  });
}
```

### 2. Updated API Call
- Changed from passing `prompt` string to `messages` array
- Increased `max_tokens` from 2000 to 4000 for longer responses
- Added logging to show when screenshots are included

### 3. Both Generation & Adjustment
- **Initial generation**: Includes screenshot
- **Auto-iteration adjustments**: Also includes screenshot
- **Manual feedback**: Also includes screenshot

## Benefits

### üéØ Better Accuracy
The AI can now:
- See exactly which button to change (not guess from HTML)
- Identify elements by their visual appearance
- Generate correct selectors based on what's visible

### üîß Better Error Detection
With more HTML/CSS context:
- Fewer missing element errors
- Better understanding of page structure
- More accurate selector generation

### üöÄ Faster Convergence
Auto-iteration should:
- Need fewer iterations to get it right
- Generate working code on first try more often
- Fix issues faster when they occur

## Example Workflow

**User Request:**
> "Change the blue CTA button to green"

**Before (Text Only):**
- AI guesses which element might be the CTA
- Might target wrong button
- Needs iteration to fix

**After (With Screenshot):**
- AI sees the blue button visually
- Identifies exact element and selector
- Generates correct code first try ‚úÖ

## Model Compatibility

**Works with these models:**
- ‚úÖ GPT-4o (best vision capabilities)
- ‚úÖ GPT-4o-mini (fast & cheap with vision)
- ‚úÖ GPT-4.1-mini (if vision supported)

**Falls back gracefully:**
- If screenshot unavailable, sends text only
- Extension still works without screenshots
- Logs indicate which mode is used

## Cost Impact

Screenshots increase token usage slightly:
- Image tokens: ~170 tokens per image (high detail)
- Still very affordable with GPT-4o-mini
- Much cheaper than extra iterations from bad code

## Testing

To verify it's working:

1. **Check logs** - Should see:
   ```
   Including screenshot in request | using vision capabilities
   ```

2. **Test with visual elements**:
   ```
   "Change the red button at the top right to blue"
   ```
   The AI should now accurately identify and target it.

3. **Monitor iterations** - Should need fewer iterations to succeed

## What This Fixes

‚ùå **Before:**
- "Element not found: .cta-button"
- Wrong selectors generated
- Many iterations needed

‚úÖ **After:**
- AI sees the button visually
- Generates correct selector
- Works on first try

---

## Summary

The extension now gives AI **full visual context** by sending:
1. ‚úÖ **Screenshot** - Visual understanding
2. ‚úÖ **50KB of HTML** - Structure context
3. ‚úÖ **20KB of CSS** - Styling context

This should **dramatically improve** code quality and reduce errors!
