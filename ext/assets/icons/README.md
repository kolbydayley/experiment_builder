# Icon Placeholder Files

The extension requires icon files for different sizes. Since we cannot generate actual PNG files in this environment, please create the following icon files:

## Required Icons:
- `icon-16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon-32.png` - 32x32 pixels  
- `icon-48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon-128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Design Guidelines:
- Use the Convert.com brand colors: #0066cc (primary blue) and #ff6b35 (secondary orange)
- Include elements representing A/B testing (arrows, split elements)
- Include coding elements (brackets, code symbols)
- Optional: AI/automation symbols (sparkles, gears)

## How to Create Icons:
1. Use the `logo.svg` as a base design
2. Export to PNG at the required sizes
3. Ensure good visibility at small sizes (16px, 32px)
4. Use transparent backgrounds
5. Follow Chrome extension icon guidelines

## Temporary Solution:
For development and testing, you can:
1. Create simple colored squares as placeholders
2. Use online icon generators
3. Convert the SVG logo to PNG using image editing tools

The extension will load without these files, but the icons won't display properly until PNG files are added.
