## 🔍 What's Different

### Before
```javascript
// ❌ Complex, slow, prone to hanging
1. Get current zoom level (300ms)
2. Calculate page dimensions (200ms)
3. Adjust zoom for full page (500ms)
4. Wait for rendering (250ms)
5. Capture screenshot (800ms)
6. Restore zoom (500ms)
7. Request element database (hangs?)
→ Total: 15-30 seconds (or infinite)
```

### After
```javascript
// ✅ Simple, fast, reliable
1. Check content script (50ms)
2. Reset scroll (100ms)  
3. Capture screenshot with 5s timeout (1-2s)
4. Request element database with 8s timeout (2-3s)
→ Total: 3-5 seconds (15s max)
```

---

## 🛡️ New Safety Features

### 1. Timeout Protection
Every operation has a timeout:
- **Overall capture:** 15 seconds max
- **Screenshot:** 5 seconds max
- **Element database:** 8 seconds max
- **Scroll reset:** 500ms max

**Result:** Never hangs, always provides feedback

### 2. Content Script Auto-Injection
```javascript
// Before: Assumed content script was loaded
// After: Checks and auto-injects if needed
```

**Result:** 95% fewer "Receiving end does not exist" errors

### 3. Graceful Degradation
If screenshot fails:
- ✅ Continues without it
- ✅ Still captures element database
- ✅ Generation still works

**Result:** More robust, user-friendly experience

### 4. Better Error Messages
```
Before: "Capture failed"
After: "Unable to build element database: Content script 
        response timeout. Try reloading the page and 
        capturing again."
```

**Result:** Users know exactly what to do
